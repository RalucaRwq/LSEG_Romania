# Log Monitoring Application
<img src="https://github.com/RalucaRwq/LSEG_Romania/raw/main/developer_experience_engineer_python/resources/images/lseg_logo.jpg" alt="Logo" width="500"/>

The goal of this challenge is to build a log monitoring application that reads the file, measures how long each job takes from start to finish, and generates warnings or errors if the processing time exceeds certain thresholds.  

## Gearing Up for the LSEG Interview Session

### **‚úÖ Goals**
1. **Parse the CSV log file.**
2. **Identify each job or task and track its start and finish times.**
3. **Calculate the duration of each job from the time it started to the time it finished.**
4. **Produce a report or output that:**
    - Logs a warning if a job took longer than 5 minutes.
    - Logs an error if a job took longer than 10 minutes.

### üíª Local Setup

### Calculate duration 
Calculate duration of each job from the time it started to the time it finished.

  Raw["fa:fa-file-csv logs.log"] -->  J1{{job_duration_calculator.py}} --> Bronze["fa:fa-file-csv job_duration_report.csv"]
```

#### Input
Simple `*.log` file containing data similar to:
```csv
"11:35:23","scheduled task 032","START","37980"
"11:35:56","scheduled task 032","END","37980"
...
```

##### Log Structure

- **HH:MM:SS** is a timestamp in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **The job description**: Describes the task or job being logged.
- Each log entry is either the **‚ÄúSTART‚Äù** or **‚ÄúEND‚Äù** of a process.
- Each job has a **PID** (Process ID) associated with it, e.g., `46578`.

#### Duration calculator
This is the Python script that processes the raw log file to calculate job durations.

#### Output
This is the output CSV file with job descriptions and their calculated durations, including status information (warning or error if the job took too long).

```csv
"PID", "job_description","start_time", "end_time", "duration", "status"
...
```

### Testing

Tested the functionality of read_log_file() and duration calculation in the output file.
